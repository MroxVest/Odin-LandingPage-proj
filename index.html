                <p>I've always liked space and the work at NASA, especially the Apollo missions. Space objects like
                    nebulas are super cool to look at.</p>

                <p>I got into coding only 5 years ago but it has been a love affair ever since. The work is challenging
                    but so much fun and learning new languages is challenging but so exciting.</p></div>

                <p>I love comic books, especially Wonder Woman. I read 10 current titles ranging from Star Wars to Black
                    Widow to Batgirls to Wonder Woman and Nubia.</p>

                <p>I also enjoy playing video games. I only really play on PS4 and Nintendo Switch as a casual gamer. My
                    favorite games are Destiny, Assassins Creed and MLB THe Show.</p>
